## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis
**Objective:** Perform clustering, regression, and classification on the Iris flower dataset.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps)
- K-Means Clustering (with Elbow method)
- Linear Regression (predicting petal length using sepal length)
- Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

#### Tools & Libraries:
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`

### 2. 📈 Stock Prices Dataset – Time Series Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze time series data to detect trends, seasonality, and smooth fluctuations.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning and date parsing
- Time series visualization using line charts
- Seasonal decomposition using `statsmodels`
- 30-day moving average smoothing
- Identifying cyclical patterns and trends

#### Tools & Libraries:
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`

### 3. 💬 Sentiment Dataset – EDA & Sentiment Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze sentiment trends over time and platforms from social media data.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning and standardization (Sentiment, Platform, Country)
- Extracting time features (year, month, day, hour)
- Sentiment distribution by platform and hour
- Top hashtags analysis
- Time series sentiment trends (monthly)

#### Tools & Libraries:
`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
